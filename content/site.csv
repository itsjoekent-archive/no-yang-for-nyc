title,No Yang for NYC
hero-lede,"Dear New York,"
hero-essay,"**Andrew Yang is running to be mayor because he needs a high profile job to keep his political career alive, not because he cares about our great city.**

Yang is deeply unqualified, embarassing, and is not putting forward proposals that would make our city better.

Andrew Yang is consistently polling at the top of the mayoral field, and it’s troubling to imagine that this many New Yorkers support a candidate who has put out so many eggregious statements and policy proposals during his NYC mayoral campaign, and past presidential campaign.

  Please do not vote for the next mayor of our city because their name sounds familiar, and take a moment to familiarize yourself with not only his campaigns history but also the other candidates running for mayor."
